Natures contracts are immutable and this is a core of decentralization. With immutability contract achives few things:

- security
- trust
- predictability

Why we need have way to upgrade contract?
Bugs, the ownerâ€™s wallet can be stolen, or an incorrect setting. If you develop a smart contract for your business, you must be prepared to react to events such as these. In many cases, the only available solution is to deploy a new instance of the contract and migrate your data to it.

Few ways to create an upgradable smart-contracts:

- Social/migrations
  Just deploy new and ask in community to use new (data migration $$$ and new contract address)
- Proxy
  call -> Proxy -> DelegateCall -> Contract A | B.
  Implementation contract - code of protocol.
  Proxy - route to latest implementation.
  Admin - user/group who upgrade to new implementation.

  Storage clashing and function clashing selector.

  - Universal Upgradeable Proxies. (Hard level, for multi same contracts environment)
  - Transparent Proxy Pattern
    Data stored on Proxy contract
    - admin cant call implementation contract, only admin function in proxy contract
