Implement ERC721 NFT with ERC20 tokens wrapping functionality.

Each user can mint a new NFT by transferring one or several different ERC20 tokens.

Users can transfer only allowed ERC20 tokens.
The owner can add or remove ERC20 tokens from the allowed tokenâ€™s registry.

Users can burn their NFTs to receive 99.5% of their ERC20 tokens back. 0.5% of all tokens remain as protocol fees.

The owner can withdraw protocol fees at any time. During the withdrawal, all fees automatically swapped to USDC with Uniswap so the owner receives only USDC
